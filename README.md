# Assignment 4: Box packing Problem

## Problem Statement:

You are tasked with packing boxes in sequences, box A can be packed inside box B, if the length, breadth , height of box A are smaller than box B.

    box A = (3,4,6)
    box B = (7,6,9)
    box A < box B

## Definitions:
   

## Task:
Write a program to implement the box packing algorithm to find  the largest number of boxes that can be packed in sequence.

## Input:
   - An integer n, representing the number of boxes.
   - A list containing the dimensions of the boxes: ex: [(1, 5, 6),(3, 4, 5),(1, 2, 3),(6, 2, 8),(5, 5,1),(2, 3,1)]
     

## Output:
   - The largest number of boxes that can be packed. ex: 2.
